### **1. Basic Concepts**
1. **What is Logistic Regression?**  
   - Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification. It predicts the probability of an event occurring by fitting data to a logistic function.

2. **Why is it called "Logistic Regression"?**  
   - It uses the logistic function (sigmoid) to model the probability of a binary outcome, despite being a regression technique.

3. **What is the difference between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression?**  
   - Linear Regression predicts continuous values, while Logistic Regression predicts probabilities for binary classification.

4. **What is the range of the logistic function?**  
   - The logistic function outputs values between 0 and 1.

5. **What is the sigmoid function?**  
   - The sigmoid function is an S-shaped curve defined as:  
     \( \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \), where \( z \) is the linear combination of inputs.

6. **What is the decision boundary in Logistic Regression?**  
   - The decision boundary is the threshold (e.g., 0.5) used to classify predictions into classes (e.g., 0 or 1).

7. **Can Logistic Regression be used for multi-class classification?**  
   - Yes, using techniques like One-vs-Rest (OvR) or Softmax Regression.

8. **What is the cost function used in Logistic Regression?**  
   - The cost function is **Log Loss** (Binary Cross-Entropy):  
     \( J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum [y \log(h(x)) + (1-y) \log(1-h(x))] \).

9. **Why is Log Loss used in Logistic Regression?**  
   - Log Loss penalizes incorrect classifications more heavily, making it suitable for probability-based models.

10. **What is the role of the threshold in Logistic Regression?**  
    - The threshold determines the classification decision. For example, if the predicted probability ≥ 0.5, classify as 1; otherwise, classify as 0.

### **2. Assumptions and Properties**
11. **What are the assumptions of Logistic Regression?**  
    - Binary outcome, linearity of independent variables and log odds, no multicollinearity, and large sample size.

12. **Does Logistic Regression assume a linear relationship?**  
    - Yes, it assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable.

13. **Can Logistic Regression handle non-linear relationships?**  
    - Not directly. Feature engineering or polynomial features can be used to capture non-linearities.

14. **Is Logistic Regression a parametric or non-parametric model?**  
    - It is a parametric model because it assumes a specific form for the relationship between inputs and outputs.

15. **What is the interpretation of coefficients in Logistic Regression?**  
    - Coefficients represent the change in log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit change in the predictor.

16. **How do you interpret the odds ratio in Logistic Regression?**  
    - The odds ratio indicates how the odds of the outcome change with a one-unit change in the predictor.

17. **What is multicollinearity, and how does it affect Logistic Regression?**  
    - Multicollinearity occurs when predictors are highly correlated, leading to unstable coefficient estimates.

18. **Can Logistic Regression handle categorical variables?**  
    - Yes, by encoding them (e.g., one-hot encoding).

19. **What is the effect of outliers on Logistic Regression?**  
    - Outliers can disproportionately influence the model, leading to poor performance.

20. **Does Logistic Regression require feature scaling?**  
    - Not necessarily, but scaling can improve convergence in gradient-based optimization.
